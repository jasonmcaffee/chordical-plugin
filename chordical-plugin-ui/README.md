# To Do
- is qwerty firing more than once? why does qwerty glitch but click doesn't?
- random notes voice may end up with duplicate? keyboard blue is too dark. click and less dark but still highlighted
- reverse chord lookup will return a different chord for the same notes when you add a note with the same octave as another note.   return all chords that match reverse,
  then find one with the right root note.
- highlight chord played with chord changed event
- smaller keyboard
- keyboard highlight notes in key.
- error modal.
- voicing names? inversions
- clean up settings modal (icon, styling)
- include font cabin into index.html webpack loader
- remember window size in state and call setSize
- randomize midi velocity to make it sound more human.
- map model/state version to new version. e.g. adding props causes old saved state to break new code.
